Caption text should be chunked into groups of text, breaking at natural speech breaks, or once a text limit of two lines has been reached.

## Publish sync'd captions, disable auto-captions
It is highly unlikely that you will finished captioning a 45-60+ minute video in one sitting. It's perfectly fine to Save the changes, even publishing them. You can also edit or add to them further in future visits. The auto-captions will still be the default captions, until to delete them once finished with the manual caption entering and syncing.
